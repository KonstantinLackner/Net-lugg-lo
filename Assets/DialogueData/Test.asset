  - 'You just moved to Feldkirch (Vorarlberg, Austria). While exploring your newly
    acquired property, you hear a ticking coming from the garden shed.

'
  - Unsuspectingly, you open its door just to discover what looks like a pipe bomb.
    You really thought you had put all of this behind you
  - when leaving Belfast for Austria. Entering the shed to have a closer look you
    lean in on the bomb. As you scrutinise the contraption,
  - "the door slams shut behind you. There\u2019s a faint red glow in the shed, you
    only notice it now you\u2019re in the dark. "
  - "It seems to be coming from a display on the pipe bomb. It reads \u201C02:00\u201D,
    you squint your eyes to adjust them to the darkness. "
  - "Now it reads \u201C01:59\u201D. The door it jammed, you throw yourself against
    it with all your weight but it opens to the inside and"
  - 'is surprisingly robust considering its age. You fumble around in your pocket,
    your phone seems more slippery than usual. '
  - 'Surely there must be somebody who can help you. You call the police. Their English
    is very bad but after what seems to you like half an hour '
  - "of explaining, they forward you to a bomb specialist. The timer now reads \u201C01:30\u201D."
